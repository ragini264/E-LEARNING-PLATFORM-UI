DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT : The “E-Learning Platform UI” is a front-end development project aimed at creating an engaging and user-friendly interface for an online education platform. As part of the CODTECH internship, this task focuses on building a multi-page user interface using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript. The platform should include key features such as course listings, progress tracking, and video embedding, providing users with a virtual classroom experience.
This project simulates real-world learning management systems (LMS) like Coursera, Udemy, or Khan Academy. Your goal is to design pages that are visually appealing, easy to navigate, and informative. The layout should be responsive and intuitive for students to browse and access educational content.

Key Features to Include:

1. Homepage:
A landing page introducing the platform. It can include banners, featured courses, or a call-to-action like "Start Learning" or "Sign Up".
2. Course Listing Page:
Display a catalog of courses with details such as course title, instructor name, duration, and difficulty level. Use grid or card-style layouts for better readability.
3. Course Detail Page:
When a user clicks on a course, it should show full details including description, curriculum, progress bar, and embedded demo or tutorial videos using HTML <iframe> for platforms like YouTube.
4. Progress Tracking UI:
Include visual progress indicators like bars or percentage counters to show how much of a course has been completed by a learner.
5. Navigation Bar:
A consistent and sticky navbar that includes links to Home, Courses, About, Contact, and Profile (optional).
6. Responsive Design:
The website should be mobile and tablet friendly. Use CSS Flexbox or Grid along with media queries to ensure the design adjusts to various screen sizes.


Deliverables:

A fully functional multi-page front-end website.
Clean and commented code using HTML5 and CSS3.
Embedding of sample educational videos using iframes.
A structured folder with separate files for HTML, CSS, and any assets (images, icons).
